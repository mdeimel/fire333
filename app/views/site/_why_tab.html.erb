Our world today is a global world. People from every culture are immigrating from everywhere
to everywhere throughout the world. In our work and play we are increasingly encountering
people from diverse backgrounds. They are the people of whom Christ spoke when he said, “…
go, make disciples of all nations….” (Matthew 28:19) They are no longer “just” overseas, but
they are now our neighbors. Many are the “least reached” people in the world. To effectively
share God’s love with them, we need to develop and grow in “cultural intelligence” (CQ). CQ
is capability to effectively relate to people from a variety of cultural backgrounds. God has
given all His followers the desire to love the people of the nations; He has given F.I.R.E the task
of facilitating His followers’ journey of moving from the desire to love people from the varied
cultural contexts to the desire to express that love respectfully and meaningfully.

<div class="heading">INTERCULTURAL</div>
<div class="content_section">
Intercultural is not about celebrating cultural diversity, but diverse cultures celebrating the Risen Lord Jesus Christ together. It is seeing Jesus through the eyes of other cultures, not getting other cultures to see “my” Jesus. It is proclaiming Jesus to all cultures and ethnic groups that He loves them and is the answer to their way of life. IT IS ABOUT JESUS BEING THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH and the center of cultural diversity. It is where all cultures have equal status, respect, and acceptance in community due to their common faith in Jesus Christ.

After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could count, from
every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before
the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palm branches were in their hands; and they cry out
with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb."
