<div class="content_section">
Our task in the mission Christ gave His followers—“make disciples of all nations”—is fourfold:
<ol>
<li><span class="heading">EQUIP</span> God’s children with biblical cross-cultural communication and relationships skills that enable them to relate effectively to the different people of the nations.
<li><span class="heading">MENTOR</span> His people in the intercultural way of life that matures their knowledge of God and strengthens their walk with Christ.
<li><span class="heading">FACILITATE</span> His followers in their journey of moving from the desire to love the people of the nations to the ability to express that love respectfully and meaningfully.
<li><span class="heading">ASSIST</span> in forming and developing biblical communities where people live out an intercultural life that is compelling to those who do not follow Christ, and is in harmony with God’s Word.
</ol>
